# Frontend environment variables for Vite
# Create a .env file in the project root with this content:

VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Note: In Vite, environment variables must be prefixed with VITE_
# to be accessible in the browser. They are accessed via import.meta.env
# instead of process.env
